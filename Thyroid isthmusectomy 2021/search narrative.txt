This file reports the search methods for the review using the PRISMA extension for searching (Rethlefsen 2021).

Information Sources and Methods
MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), the Cochrane Library (Wiley), and Web of Science Core Collection (all editions) (Clarivate) were searched. The study registry Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was included as part of the Cochrane Library search. Citation searching was conducted on August 13, 2021 examining both cited and citing references. Citation searching was initially conducted using SnowGlobe (McWeeny 2021), with Scopus (Elsevier) used to retrieve the complete references.

Search strategies
The strategy consists of two concepts, isthmusectomy and well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma, combined with Boolean operators. Both controlled vocabulary and free-text keywords were identified using the Yale MeSH Analyzer; proximity operators were incorporated in order to retrieve variations of phrases. 

MEDLINE (Ovid): 
isthmusectom$.mp. and (exp Thyroid Neoplasms/ or exp Adenocarcinoma, Follicular/ or exp Thyroid Cancer, Papillary/ or (follicular adenocarcinoma$ or (((differentiated or papillary or follicular or nonmedullary) adj3 thyroid) adj3 (adenocarcinoma$ or cancer$ or carcinoma$ or incidentaloma or neoplasm$ or nodule$ or tumo?r$))).mp.)

Embase (Ovid):
isthmusectom$.mp. AND (exp differentiated thyroid cancer/ or exp Thyroid tumor/ OR exp adenocarcinoma/ OR (follicular adenocarcinoma$ OR (((differentiated OR papillary OR follicular OR nonmedullary) ADJ3 thyroid) ADJ3 (adenocarcinoma$ OR cancer$ OR carcinoma$ or incidentaloma or neoplasm$ or nodule$ or tumo?r$))).mp.)

The Cochrane Library (Wiley):
isthmusectom?:ti,ab,kw AND ([mh "Thyroid Neoplasms"] OR [mh "Adenocarcinoma, Follicular"] OR [mh "Thyroid Cancer, Papillary"] OR (("follicular" NEAR/2 adenocarcinoma?) OR (((differentiated OR papillary OR follicular OR nonmedullary) NEAR/3 thyroid) NEAR/3 (adenocarcinoma? OR cancer? OR carcinoma? OR incidentaloma OR neoplasm? OR nodule? OR tumo?r?))):ti,ab,kw)

Web of Science Core Collection (all editions) (Wiley):
TS=(isthmusectom* AND (("follicular adenocarcinoma*" OR (((differentiated OR papillary OR follicular OR nonmedullary) NEAR/3 thyroid) NEAR/3 (adenocarcinoma* OR cancer* OR carcinoma* OR incidentaloma OR neoplasm* OR nodule* OR tumo*r*)))))

No limits or published search filters were used. The search was last updated on June 7, 2021.

Peer review
The search strategy was peer reviewed using PRESS by Judy Stribling on June 1, 2021 (McGowan 2016).

Managing records
The total number of records from each database were as follows:
MEDLINE: 113
Embase: 169
The Cochrane Library: 1
Web of Science: 51
334 records were imported into Covidence; 120 duplicate records were automatically removed upon import. During citation searching, 203 cited and cited references were uploaded to Covidence; 17 duplicate records were automatically removed upon import.

Discussion of search methods:
Ovid MEDLINE and Embase were searched in order to identify relevant published literature. The Cochrane Library was searched in order to identify any unpublished trials indexed in the Cochrane CENTRAL trials register. Web of Science Core Collection was searched in order to identify studies that had been presented as meeting abstracts but not yet published as a full-length journal article. Web of Science was searched rather than Scopus based on recommendations in Bramer (2017).

All sources were searched from dates of inception. The search was initially developed in MEDLINE, then translated to other databases using the Polyglot tool (Clark 2020); the automatically translated searches were further adjusted by hand.  

The strategy consists of 2 concepts: thyroid isthmusectomy and well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Due to the small number of results retrieved, the authors considered eliminating the hedge for thyroid carcinoma and searching only for isthmusectomy; however, this added a large number of studies discussing horseshoe kidney instead of thyroid. Both controlled vocabulary and free-text keywords were identified using the Yale MeSH Analyzer (Grossetta Nardini 2021); proximity operators were incorporated in order to retrieve variations of phrases.

There is no MeSH corresponding to well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma, and the relevant MeSH fall into different branches of the tree. Controlled vocabulary terms were exploded whenever possible. 

Additional keywords (e.g. nonmedullary, incidentaloma) were identified by examining entry terms in both MeSH and EMTREE. 

3 members of the study team identified a list of 8 studies from preliminary searching; this formed a validation set, tested in both Embase and MEDLINE.
