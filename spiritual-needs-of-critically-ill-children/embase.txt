Tested the following:
- Religious keywords (eg Christian, Muslim/Islam, Jewish, etc) but additional articles retrieved appeared irrelevant (based on review of first 50)
- "deity” and assorted variations but they don’t retrieve anything relevant. “God/gods” retrieves a lot of false positives and nothing new relevant (“playing God” pops up a lot) but “belief in god or faith in god” pulled up 1 new possibly relevant article. 
- Adding family, sibling, parents, etc to the child hedge but they increased irrelevant retrieval without retrieving any relevant new articles.
