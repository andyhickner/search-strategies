Study design: The gold standard for valid race/ethnicity data is from self-reporting surveys.
Outcomes being studied: 
1.) The percentage of incomplete data 
2.) The percentage of inaccurate data

What is the aim of this systematic review?
   The objective of this study is to establish the validity of race and ethnicity data contained within electronic health records (EHRs). There are several studies that address this topic amongst a variety of EHRs. This study will look to summarize the findings and data of these studies to provide a broader perspective on the topic. The study will report the overall validity of the EHR data and the validity as it pertains to specific race and ethnic categories.
   
   There are three particular implications of concern with invalid data. 1.) Population health data will be inaccurate because there is no valid count of patients by race/ethnicity. 2.) Racial minorities lose benefit from large database research because their data is missing. 3.) Bias will be reinforced within the medical research field.
